# Introduction

Welcome to the OSMC technical documentation. This documentation will help you understand the OSMC development and build processes. This is useful to anyone that wants to build and contribute to OSMC as well as anyone that is just curious as to the inner workings of the project.

This documentation can be found and edited on GitHub [here] (https://github.com/samnazarko/osmc-docs). Feel free to fork it and make any changes if you feel something's missing or not quite right!

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `meowmeowmeow` with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
