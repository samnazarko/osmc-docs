# Introduction

Welcome to the OSMC technical documentation. This documentation will help you understand the OSMC development and build processes. This is useful to anyone that wants to build and contribute to OSMC as well as anyone that is just curious as to the inner workings of the project.

This documentation can be found and edited on GitHub [here] (https://github.com/samnazarko/osmc-docs). Feel free to fork it and make any changes if you feel something's missing or not quite right!
